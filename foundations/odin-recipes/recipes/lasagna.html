<h2>Recipes</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a beloved dish that combines layers of rich flavors and textures, making it a favorite in many households.
    Traditional lasagna recipes often feature sheets of pasta layered with a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel or
    ricotta cheese, and a generous topping of melted mozzarella. Variations abound, allowing for endless creativity in
    the kitchen. Some recipes incorporate vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or eggplant for a lighter, healthier twist,
    while others might use different types of cheese or incorporate a white sauce instead of the classic tomato-based
    one.</p>
<p>Vegetarian and vegan versions have also become popular, using alternatives like lentils, tofu, or plant-based
    meat substitutes. No matter the ingredients, the key to a great lasagna is in the layering process and baking it to
    perfection, resulting in a comforting, flavorful dish that’s perfect for family dinners or special occasions.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef (or a mix of beef)
        and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until the onion is translucent and the garlic is
        fragrant.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, sugar (if using), dried basil, dried oregano,
        salt, black pepper, and chopped fresh parsley. Bring to a simmer and let the sauce cook for about 30 minutes,
        stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to
        the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, and salt. Mix
        well.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella) until all ingredients are used, ending with a
        final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until
        the cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is heated through.</li>
    <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for about 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
